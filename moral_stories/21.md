## Story 21

<div class='text-hightlight'>
You are a crewmember on a submarine traveling under a large iceberg. An explosion has damaged the ship, injured several crewmembers and collapsed the only access between the upper and lower decks of the ship. You and ten survivors are in the upper section, which does not have enough oxygen for all of you to survive until you reach the surface. One single crewmember is lying unconscious in the lower section, where there is enough oxygen.
