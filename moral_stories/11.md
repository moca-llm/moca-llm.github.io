## Story 11

<div class='text-hightlight'>
On the test ground of a modern railroad property an unmanned speed-train that normally can be remote-controlled got out of control due to a technical defect. This speed-train is heading towards three railroad workers that are maintaining the tracks. Since these workers are wearing a novel hearing protection, they would not notice the speed-train on time and hence would be run over by it. Karl, an employee of the rail track control center, recognizes the upcoming accident. However, it is not possible to stop the train on time anymore. There is only one possibility to avoid the death of the three workers: Karl could run to a nearby bridge on which a heavy worker is standing and push this worker from the bridge. Thereby this worker would fall on the tracks and collide with the speed-train. Due to the collision with the heavy worker (Karl would not be heavy enough to stop the train) the speed-train would stop before it reaches the three workers. The heavy worker would lose his life due to the collision.
