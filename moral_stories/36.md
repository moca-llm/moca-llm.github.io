## Story 36

<div class='text-hightlight'>
You are the explosives expert of a company that has been hired to demolish a skyscraper. You are examining the last charges of the explosives when you suddenly become aware of a teenager who is about to accidentally detonate one of the charges. The explosion will result in the building's uncontrolled collapse over you, the teenager, and the crowd of spectators. The teenager stands several floors below you and cannot hear you. If you reactivate the buildingâ€™s electricity, the boy will get an electric shock because he is touching an open circuit. This will kill him, but it will save you and the crowd by preventing the explosion.
