# Moral Stories

## Story 38

<div class='text-hightlight'>
You are the bus driver of a kindergarten trip to the zoo. On the way, faulty tires cause the bus to plunge off a bridge and into a roaring river. You and three of the children are still in the sinking bus. The rest has already been swept away by the river. You grab the two children next to you and begin to swim towards the exit, but bulky seats are blocking it.
</div>
