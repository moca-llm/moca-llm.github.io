## Story 55

<div class='text-hightlight'>
You are on a rowboat with a tour guide on a lake in Alaska. Nearby, three children have fallen off their boat and are in danger of freezing to death. You rescue the children, but one of them is very heavy and you realize that if you keep him on board your boat will sink and all will die. Neither you nor the guide can leave the boat because you are rowing and the guide is giving CPR to one of the children.
