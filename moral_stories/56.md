## Story 56

<div class='text-hightlight'>
You are on a rowboat with a tour guide on a lake in Alaska. Nearby, three children have fallen off their boat and are in danger of freezing to death.  After you rescue two of the children, you realize that the weight of the third child would cause your boat to sink and all would die. Neither you nor the guide can leave the boat because you are rowing and the guide is giving CPR to one of the children.
