## Story 10

<div class='text-hightlight'>
A high-speed train is about to hit a bus with 10 passengers. An employee of the train company could redirect the train to a side track where a bus with 2 passengers is sitting. The side track loops back to the main track. The redirected train would reach and harm the 10 passengers on the main track if the bus on the side track were not there. The affected passengers would be seriously harmed.
