# Causal Stories

## Story 144

<div class='text-hightlight'>
Ed is driving to the theater with a cord hanging out the side of his car. He approaches a rock that is about to fall off the side of the road and down a steep cliff. If he slows down, the cord will block the path of the rock and prevent it from falling, but Ed will be late to the theater. Ed keeps driving quickly and the rock falls off the side of the road.
