# Causal Stories

## Story 26

<div class='text-hightlight'>
Tom works for a demolition company, and today he is demolishing a building by implosion. The building will implode automatically at 5:00 PM if both the safety switch is off and knob A is switched on. At 4:00 PM, the safety switch is off, and knob A is on. At that time, Tom checks to see if knob A is on, and he sees that it's on. So, he does not change the position of knob A at all. Because the building would implode if both the safety switch is off and knob A is switched on, the building implodes at 5:00 PM.
