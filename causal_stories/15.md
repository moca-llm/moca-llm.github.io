# Causal Stories

## Story 15

<div class='text-hightlight'>
Jack is driving five sick people to the hospital with a cord hanging out the side of his car. He approaches a rock climber resting by the side of the road. If he does not slow down, the climber will be knocked off the road by the cord and fall down a steep cliff. If he does slow down, the five sick people will die before they reach the hospital. Jack keeps driving quickly and knocks the rock climber off the side of the road.
