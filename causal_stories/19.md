# Causal Stories

## Story 19

<div class='text-hightlight'>
Sara has an electric guitar that she plays through an amplifier. The guitar will play through the amplifier if either the amplifier is set to channel A or the power mixer is turned on. Today, the amplifier is set to channel A. Sara checks to see if the power mixer is on. She sees that the power mixer is not turned on, and she turns on the power mixer and adjusts it. Because the guitar will play through the amplifier if either the amplifier is set to channel A or the power mixer is turned on, Sara's guitar plays through the amplifier.
