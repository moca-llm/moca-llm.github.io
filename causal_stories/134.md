## Story 134

<div class='text-hightlight'>
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. One day, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, Alice logs in at 9:30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address.
