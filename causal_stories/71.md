# Causal Stories

## Story 71

<div class='text-hightlight'>
Bill's wife, Sue, is out of town for the weekend. She leaves Bill a message that says, 'I just saw this marvelous bookend. It's called a Bartlett bookend. So pretty! I'm going to go back tomorrow and get one. It will be perfect for the left side of our bookshelf'. Bill goes and visits his friend. Bill and his friend talk for a while, and when Bill asks if his friend is willing to sell the bookend, his friend is happy to sell it. Bill makes an offer, but his friend insists on him not paying so much. Finally, Bill buys the right-side Bartlett bookend from his friend and goes home. Then the next day, Sue goes and buys the left-side Bartlett bookend. So, when Sue got home, they had the paired set of bookends.
