# Causal Stories

## Story 140

<div class='text-hightlight'>
A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, both the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do its homework. However, there were no pencils left in the box. Polar bear cannot finish his homework.
