# Causal Stories

## Story 111

<div class='text-hightlight'>
Drew, Kylie, Oliver, and Jen are regular customers at a small, local coffee shop. Given the selling price of the coffee and the cost of daily operation, the coffee shop will turn a profit if anyone orders coffee on a given day. Only one person ordering coffee is needed for the coffee shop to turn a profit that day. Drew, Kylie, Oliver, and Jen all usually order coffee on Tuesdays. This Tuesday, as usual, Drew ordered coffee. The same day, Kylie ordered coffee, Oliver ordered coffee, and Jen also ordered coffee. Since at least one person ordered coffee on Tuesday, the coffee shop made a profit that day.
