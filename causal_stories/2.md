# Causal Stories

## Story 2

<div class='text-hightlight'>
Lauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Jane logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Lauren decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately.
