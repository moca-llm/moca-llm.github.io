# Causal Stories

## Story 18

<div class='text-hightlight'>
Ned has a new motorboat. When Ned turns the key, the motorboat starts if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position. Today, the gear is in neutral, and the motor is in the lock position. Ned checks the motor to see if it is in the lock position. He sees that it is in the lock position, and he does not change its position at all. Because the motorboat would start if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position, the motorboat starts when Ned turns the key.
