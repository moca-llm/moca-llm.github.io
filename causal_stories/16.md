# Causal Stories

## Story 16

<div class='text-hightlight'>
Jack is driving five sick people to the hospital with a cord hanging out the side of his car. He approaches a rock climber who is about to fall off the side of the road and down a steep cliff. If he slows down, the rock climber can use the cord to prevent himself from falling, but the five sick people will die before they reach the hospital. Jack keeps driving quickly and the climber falls off the side of the road.
