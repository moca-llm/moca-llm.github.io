# Causal Stories

## Story 20

<div class='text-hightlight'>
Sara has an electric guitar that she plays through an amplifier. The guitar will play through the amplifier if either the amplifier is set to channel A or the power mixer is turned on. Today, the amplifier is set to channel A. Sara checks to see if the power mixer is on. She sees that the power mixer is turned on, and she does not turn off the power mixer or adjust it at all. Because the guitar will play through the amplifier if either the amplifier is set to channel A or the power mixer is turned on, Sara's guitar plays through the amplifier.
