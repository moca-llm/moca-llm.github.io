# Causal Stories

## Story 92

<div class='text-hightlight'>
Joe was about to go pick up his child from a school in the suburbs. In the parking lot, he stopped to talk with friends. Because of this delay in picking up his son, Joe's neighbor, who waited 15 min for Joe to show up, took the child home in his car. On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver. Joe's son, the only seriously hurt victim, received severe leg injuries.
