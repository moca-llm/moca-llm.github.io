# Causal Stories

## Story 34

<div class='text-hightlight'>
Laurie likes GC brand coffee. GC is doing a new promotion for their new coffee flavor where customers can receive a free sample. Customers will receive a free sample if both they have previously purchased coffee beans from GC and they are subscribed to the GC email list. Laurie has previously purchased coffee beans from GC, and she is subscribed to the GC email list. When she hears about the promotion, Laurie checks to see if she is subscribed to the email list, and she sees that she is. So, she does not change her subscription status, and she remains subscribed to the email list. Because customers will receive a free sample if both they have previously purchased coffee beans from GC and they are subscribed to the GC email list, Laurie receives a free sample.
